###    Educase Assignment

## Objective

    Create a pixel-perfect React JS application based on the provided Adobe XD design, ensuring a clean, well-formatted codebase. The application should feature a centered mobile app interface on the webpage with seamless and efficient navigation between pages. The final project must be hosted on a platform like Vercel, and the code should be shared via a public GitHub repository.

### Demo: https://educase-assignment-puce.vercel.app/

## Tech Stack

    React JS, React Router, Tailwind CSS, GitHub for hosting the repository, Vercel for Deploying the application


### Guidelines to develop a project

### 1. Design Implementation

- **Mobile App Interface**:
    - The mobile app interface should be centered on the webpage.
    - Ensure the design is responsive, maintaining the mobile app appearance as per the Adobe XD prototype, even on larger screens.

- **Navigation**: 
    - Implement smooth and efficient navigation between pages as defined in the Adobe XD design, ensuring a seamless user experience.

### 2. Technical Requirements

- **Framework**: Use React JS to build the application.
- **Code Quality**:
    - Write clean, well-structured, and well-commented code.
    - Follow consistent formatting (e.g., use Prettier or ESLint for code formatting).
    - Organize the codebase using a modular structure (e.g., separate components, styles, and utilities).
- **Styling**:
    - Use modern CSS techniques (e.g., CSS-in-JS, styled-components, or Tailwind CSS) for styling.
    - Ensure the styling matches the Adobe XD design precisely.
- **Dependencies**:
    - Use CDN-hosted React and related dependencies (e.g., React, ReactDOM) from a reliable source like `cdn.jsdelivr.net`.
    - Optionally use Babel for JSX support.


### Submission Instructions

- **GitHub Repository**:
    - Create a public GitHub repository to host the project code.
    - Ensure the repository includes a clear `README.md` with instructions for running the project locally.
    - Commit code frequently with meaningful commit messages.
- **Hosting**:
    - Deploy the application on a hosting platform such as Vercel, Netlify, or a similar service.
    - Ensure the hosted application is accessible and functional.
- **Deliverables**:
    - Share the link to the public GitHub repository.
    - Share the hosted application link (e.g., Vercel or Netlify URL).
